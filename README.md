# The Design Manual

### An app that uses a JSON formatted data to show my collection of free and premium resources regarding some fields.

### Features:

- Home page to access your favourite resources out of the pool.
  
- Small containers with pinning facility to mark it as favourite.
  
- A small thumbnail of the brand logo in every tile.
  
- A small description that gives a preview of what you should expect.
  
- Tags like freemium, premium, stock photos, added to give user a detailed preview of the functionality of the website.
  

#### Keep in mind:

- The list is inbuilt in the application itself, and is not updated regularly over the internet, so if any new data enters, the user will need to update the application itself.
  
- The thumbnails are not provided in the application. It downloads the data from the internet using the address provided in the Data embedded.
  

##### Bugs Introduced:

- The pinning function right now only works in the detailed page of any element.
- Many of the functionalities are not added right now.
